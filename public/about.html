<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have some experience developing using HTML, CSS and PHP. I am currently taking courses to become a Web Developer,
  using the technologies that are more current.</p>

<p>I studied Electronics Engineering and what I liked the most was programming. I worked five years as a PLC programmer
  and also doing some web developing, but my passion was always programming web.</p>

<p>My goal is to become a junior Web Developer and eventually be a senior Developer.</p>
